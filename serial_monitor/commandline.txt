Serial Port Monitor provides command line options to launch and start monitoring serial ports automatically:

  SerialMonitor.EXE /new   
      PORT
      [A] [T] [L] [R] [D]

where
•“PORT” defines the serial port to monitor (COM1, COM4, etc.)
•“A” means that monitoring should be started automatically once you press the “Enter” button
•“T” means that “Table View” should be toggled on
•“L” means that “Line View” should be toggled on
•“R” means that “Terminal View” should be toggled on
•“D” means that “Data View” should be toggled on

Example:


SerialMonitor.exe /new COM1 ATLRD
 



This command launches Serial Port Monitor and straightaway opens COM1 port. All visualizers are enabled.



SerialMonitor.exe /new COM1 ATLRD
